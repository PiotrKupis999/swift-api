## üì¶ General Info
**Swift API** is a lightweight and efficient RESTful backend built using **Spring Boot**.

The application parses SWIFT codes from a provided file, stores them in a database, and exposes four endpoints for retrieving and manipulating the data.

<br>


## ‚ú® Features  

### Backend  


- ‚úÖ **SWIFT Code Parsing**: The application parses SWIFT codes from a provided file and organizes them by headquarters and branches.

- ‚úÖ **Database Storage**: Data is stored in a fast, low-latency database (choose appropriate DB: relational/non-relational) for efficient retrieval.

- ‚úÖ **REST API**: Four key endpoints expose the SWIFT code data, allowing for querying, adding, and deleting entries.

- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: The API gracefully handles edge cases with clear, informative error messages.

- ‚úÖ **Containerized Application**: The application and database are containerized for easy setup and deployment.

### Frontend  
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Web UI** ‚Äì Built with **React**, providing an easy way to manage SWIFT codes.
  
- ‚úÖ **User-Friendly Forms** ‚Äì Add or delete SWIFT codes via simple forms.
  
- ‚úÖ **Search Functionality** ‚Äì Find SWIFT codes and banks by code or country.
  
- ‚úÖ **Live Error Handling** ‚Äì Displays error messages (e.g., invalid SWIFT codes).

## üß∞ Setup 
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/PiotrKupis999/swift-api
cd swift-api
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Project
Make sure you have Java 21 installed, then run:

```sh
mvn clean install
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Now the API is available at http://localhost:8080

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Log to H2 database ***(optional)***

The database is now available at http://localhost:8080/h2-console
| Login           |                        |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Saved Settings: | Generic H2 (Embedded)  |         
| Setting Name:	  | Generic H2 (Embedded)  |         
| Driver Class:	  | org.h2.Driver          |      
| JDBC URL:   	  | jdbc:h2:mem:swiftdb    |

## üçì Frontend 

The web UI consists of four main sections:
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add SWIFT Code ‚Äì Form to enter a new SWIFT code, including bank name, country, and headquarters status.
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Delete SWIFT Code ‚Äì Remove a SWIFT code by providing the bank name and country code.
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Find SWIFT Code ‚Äì Search for a bank by its SWIFT code and retrieve details.
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Find Banks by Country ‚Äì Search for all banks within a specific country.
